AUTHOR'S PRESENTATION
=====================
I felt like  I should release the source  for my homepage at devio.us/~blue
as  I already shared it  with some people  who wanted to have  a look at it.

It's  nothing complicated,  a really simple layout-engine  with  some basic
template-parsing/caching  and  a directory listing script. The jQuery stuff
that makes the listing somewhat more beautiful is optional but yet included.
